# Prediction Market Site

## Overview

The **Prediction Market Site** is a decentralized platform where users can create, trade, and resolve markets on real-world events. Participants can buy and sell shares representing possible outcomes of future events, and prices reflect the crowd’s aggregated probability estimates.

This project aims to make forecasting transparent, accessible, and incentive-aligned.

---

## Objectives

* **Crowdsourced Forecasting**: Harness collective intelligence to predict real-world events.
* **Decentralization**: Trustless market creation and resolution using blockchain smart contracts.
* **Liquidity & Fairness**: Automated market makers (AMMs) for continuous liquidity.
* **Verifiable Resolution**: Outcomes determined via oracles or decentralized dispute resolution.
* **Transparency**: Open-source code and auditable market history.

---

## Architecture

### 1. **Frontend**

* Web interface (React/Next.js).
* Market browsing, creation, and trading.
* Portfolio and statistics dashboards.

### 2. **Smart Contracts**

* **Market Factory**: Create new markets with event details.
* **Outcome Tokens**: ERC-20–like tokens representing possible outcomes.
* **Automated Market Maker (AMM)**: Provides continuous pricing.
* **Settlement Module**: Resolves markets through trusted oracles or decentralized dispute mechanisms.

### 3. **Backend**

* Event indexing service.
* APIs for market data (prices, volumes, liquidity).
* Notifications and analytics.

### 4. **Storage & Data**

* On-chain: Market definitions, trades, liquidity pools.
* Off-chain: UI enhancements, charts, historical datasets.

## Example Data Schema

```json
{
  "market_id": "string",
  "question": "Will SpaceX land humans on Mars before 2030?",
  "outcomes": ["Yes", "No"],
  "created_by": "0xUserWallet",
  "liquidity_pool": {
    "yes_price": 0.45,
    "no_price": 0.55
  },
  "volume": 12345.67,
  "status": "open | resolved | disputed",
  "resolution": {
    "outcome": "Yes",
    "oracle": "chainlink",
    "timestamp": "ISO8601"
  }
}
```

## Example Use Cases

* **Sports**: Who will win the next World Cup?
* **Finance**: Will Bitcoin close above \$100k in 2025?
* **Science**: Will a new cancer treatment receive FDA approval by 2027?
* **Community Governance**: Will proposal #123 pass in the DAO?
